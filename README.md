Currently experimental effort towards rust tools for parsing the sel4 xml API's.

This contains a library sel4_xml_types for parsing:
	* syscall xml
	* api xml

besides the libraries there are some unfinished (unstarted?) tools 

This does not contain a library for reading git repo manifest.xml.
I have written one but it is elsewhere, [git-repo-manifest crate](https://github.com/pullreqr/manifest-tool)
